### Reflection

This was a 12 month long project built for my BTech final year presentation . Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  
Originally the idea was presented ny my mentor Dr. Amit neogi, and with further research and discussion, I created the wireframes and basic technologies to be used.
